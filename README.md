# WLC2
WIRELESS LAN CONTROLLER CONFIGURATION

## CURRENT STATUS
For configuring a WLC (Wireless LAN Controller), currently it is mandatory to adjust all settings manually via copy & paste into the terminal of a previously prepared excel spreadsheet of terminal commands.

## GOAL
The goal for this configuration process is to simplify the entire setup process of a WLC. Therefore a new software is introduced, which is called “wl2c” (Wireless Lan Controller Configuration). This software enables the user to setup a configuration once using a web interface. After a configuration is created it can be rolled out to any WLC given an IP address.

# TODO:
- Ask for manufacturer netmiko device type
